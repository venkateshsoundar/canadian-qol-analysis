    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality of life (QoL) refers to an individual's perception of their position in life, covering physical health, mental health, and social relationships, relative to their expectations and cultural context (World Health Organization, 1995).  In health research, QoL is affected by many factors, including health drivers and health barriers.  Health drivers such as physical activity and mental health consultations typically have a positive influence on QoL, while health barriers like smoking, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use are often linked to negative health outcomes (Haskell et al. 2007; Rehm et al., 2009).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the relationship between these health drivers and barriers, focusing on their impact on physical and mental health outcomes.  Using Visualizations and correlation statistics, we will analyze variables such as body mass index (BMI), self-reported health status, and stress to evaluate the influence of health barriers.  Following this, we will perform subgroup analyses to determine how age, sex, region, and education are impacted by these health barriers. Depending on our findings we will either help identify the most vulnerable populations and suggest targeted interventions to improve their QoL, or try to suggest more appropriate ways to analyze this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and Guiding Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the Canadian Community Health Survey as our dataset. Specifically, we will be using the 2019-2020 microdata file available at Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2023).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian Community Health Survey is an annual survey that collects data from respondents across Canada and differentiates them by their province and respective health regions. The survey is voluntary response but is designed to have a large representative sample, all identifying data is removed prior to the release of the microdata file. The survey collects data on a wide variety of health indicators, potential health determinants, and plenty of demographic data to assist in analysis. The datafile comes in the form of a CSV file and comes with a data dictionary and a very accessible format given the sheer size of the CSV file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 691 individual columns including the respondent’s record number with the columns representing the variables. For each of these 691 variables there are 108,252 individual responses as the rows for the data file. We plan to choose a specific number of variables and analyze them according to the questions listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our guiding questions can be listed into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Health Drivers Vs. Health Barriers\n",
    "   1. How does alcohol consumption affect mental health among different age groups?\n",
    "   2. How does cannabis use impact stress levels?\n",
    "   3. What is the relationship between smoking and physical health outcomes?\n",
    "   4. Which demographic groups (age, sex, region) are most affected by health barriers?\n",
    "   \n",
    "b. Health Drivers Vs. Health Improvements\n",
    "   1. What is the relationship between regular exercise and self-reported health status?\n",
    "   2. How does stress influence the maintenance or improvement of mental health?"

However, the results can also be influnced by the factor that the number of people who didn't use cannabis is significantly more than the number of people who used cannabis in this dataset."

    "When we start our analysis for this dataset, the most important barriers which we chose to focus is smoking and how it impacted the health levels.Also Smoking has complex associations with BMI and various physical health outcomes.Health effects of smoking can lead to conditions that may influence weight, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can decrease physical activity levels.\\\n",
    "Smoking can affect metabolism and body fat distribution, often leading to more visceral fat (fat around internal organs) compared to non-smokers, which is linked to higher health risks.While smokers may have a lower BMI, smoking itself is associated with numerous health risks, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory issues, and cancer. These risks can outweigh any benefits of having a lower BMI.\\\n",
    "Many individuals experience weight gain after quitting smoking, as appetite increases and metabolism may normalize. This can lead to concerns about obesity, especially if individuals do not adopt healthier eating habits or increase physical activity. \\\n",
    "Main Objective for this question is to analyze the relation between Smoking/BMI against Health level Indicators derived from the survery results.Analyze the health improvments whether Stopped Smoking and Physically Active Indicators impact and improve the health level of the people"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From our analysis of how alcohol consumption affected mental health among different age groups, we saw that individuals who moderately consume alcohol may report a better self-perceived mental health and life satisfaction.  However, if alcohol consumption becomes excessive, especially in the case of frequent binge drinking, we can see a noticeable decrease in self-perceived mental health and life satisfaction. This trend is noticeable across all age groups to varying degrees. It should be noted that weak correlation between alcohol consumption and mental health variables indicates that there are additional variables that play a greater role in affecting these mental health variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our investigation of how cannabis use impact people’s perceived stress level, we found a weak trend that using cannabis will slightly increase perceived life stress and work stress. Due to the medicinal nature of cannabis, it can affect one’s nerve system in some degree. It is difficult to say how strong that effect is, as we see people who used cannabis and feeling stressful or not at all stressful are evenly spread out on the graph. Therefore we conclude that using cannabis can slightly increase the stress level in both life and work aspect, but the increase is not obvious. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall we infer that smoking has a major impact on physical health upon our analysis against geography & gender, however overweight/obese doesn't have as strong of a relationship to smoking. People who stopped smoking show greater improvements in health levels.  We can also infer that the BMI is greatly improved for the people with higher physical activity, and it declines for people with no physical activity.  Hence we conclude that Smoking is directly related to Physical health in converse to BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our exploration of which demographic groups are mostly affected health barriers, we found that females tend to use cannabis more and smoke more frequently by approximately 8% compared to males. However, males consumed alcohol more often than females and binge drank morecompared to females. When broken down by age, we found that a lot more teenagers (12 to 17 years) use cannabis than middle aged groups, then the trend shows an immediate decrease on 18 to 34 years group. After that we see a increasing trend on each age group until 65 years and older reaches the maximum cannabis use. This might be because some senior people need cannabis for medical treatment. In terms of smoking frequency, both 12 to 17 years and 65 years and older smoke most frequently, and other age groups smoke slightly less frequently than the former two age groups. When looking at different regions, there are almost equal amounts of cannabis use and smoking frequency across each province except territories. This may be due to a lower population in these territories. In terms of alcohol consumptions, our analysis revealed that people in Quebec and British Columbia consume alcohol most often, while people in territories consume more alcohol on one occasion compared to the other provinces. \n",
    "\n",
    "When broken down to household education level, people with no secondary school education use more cannabis than secondary and post-secondary educated people, but the differences between these groups are not obvious. We found that people with post-secondary education smoke slightly more often than the other two groups. Our analysis revealed that people with post-secondary education drink alcohol most frequently, with the secondary education and no-secondary education group following closely behind. When looking at binge drinking, people with secondary and post-secondary education binge drank more compared to no-secondary education group. \n",
    "\n",
    "From our investigation of how physical activity affects reported health we saw that there is a noticeable trend that people who reported they had better health were more likely to be above the recommended physical activity guideline. When broken down by age group we could see that that trend was stronger in older populations than younger populations. Similarly, our analysis of how stress affects reported mental health showed that once again respondents who reported mental health were more likely to report they had lower stress levels. While the trend continued to show ill all age groups older age groups appeared to be more likely to select the 2 extremes to not at all stressed or extremely stressed. Additionally, a respondent’s self perception of their weight did seem to relate to their mental health. To conclude these two questions, we have shown that there is at least a relationship between these factors and how a respondent reported their general and mental health state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some limitations of our results are that they only utilized visual inspection and correlation statistics.  While correlation statistics are useful at identifying a relationship between variables, we cannot guarantee causation.  The combination of visual inspection with correlation statistics should give us a better idea of this relationship, we still cannot guarantee that to be the case.  To better investigate these relationships, future testing could see the introduction of regression models, most likely of the ordinal variety, as well as interaction terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results of our analysis we saw that alcohol consumption and smoking both resulted in worsening some key variables related to quality of life, those being mental and physical health.  Although the strengths of these relationships varied, we can still suggest that reducing the frequency of drinking and smoking is likely to lead to an improved quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that cannabis use showed a weak trend indicating that cannabis slightly increases perceived life and work stress, potentially due to its effects on the nervous system. \n",
    "\n",
    "While females tend to use cannabis and smoke more frequently than males, males more frequently consume alcohol and binge drink. Teenagers exhibit higher cannabis use, declining in older age groups, except for seniors (65+), where we see an increase, possibly due to medical use. Smoking and alcohol consumption also varied by region, with Quebec and British Columbia leading in alcohol consumption frequency, while territories showed a higher frequency of binge drinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that regular physical activity is related to improved self-reported physical and mental health, especially in an older population.  Therefore, encouraging regular exercise, particularly in an older population should lead to an improved quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, although the exact strength of our relationships is unknown, it is likely that promoting reductions in the frequency of alcohol and smoking, in addition to encouraging physical activity, may contribute to an increase in mental and physical health, and therefore improve ones quality of life.\n",
