    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quality of life (QoL) refers to an individual's perception of their position in life, covering physical health, mental health, and social relationships, relative to their expectations and cultural context (World Health Organization, 1995).  In health research, QoL is affected by many factors, including health drivers and health barriers.  Health drivers such as physical activity and mental health consultations typically have a positive influence on QoL, while health barriers like smoking, alcohol consumption, and cannabis use are often linked to negative health outcomes (Haskell et al. 2007; Rehm et al., 2009).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the relationship between these health drivers and barriers, focusing on their impact on physical and mental health outcomes.  Using Visualizations and correlation statistics, we will analyze variables such as body mass index (BMI), self-reported health status, and stress to evaluate the influence of health barriers.  Following this, we will perform subgroup analyses to determine how age, sex, region, and education are impacted by these health barriers. Depending on our findings we will either help identify the most vulnerable populations and suggest targeted interventions to improve their QoL, or try to suggest more appropriate ways to analyze this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and Guiding Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the Canadian Community Health Survey as our dataset. Specifically, we will be using the 2019-2020 microdata file available at Statistics Canada (Statistics Canada, 2023).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian Community Health Survey is an annual survey that collects data from respondents across Canada and differentiates them by their province and respective health regions. The survey is voluntary response but is designed to have a large representative sample, all identifying data is removed prior to the release of the microdata file. The survey collects data on a wide variety of health indicators, potential health determinants, and plenty of demographic data to assist in analysis. The datafile comes in the form of a CSV file and comes with a data dictionary and a very accessible format given the sheer size of the CSV file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 691 individual columns including the respondent’s record number with the columns representing the variables. For each of these 691 variables there are 108,252 individual responses as the rows for the data file. We plan to choose a specific number of variables and analyze them according to the questions listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our guiding questions can be listed into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Health Drivers Vs. Health Barriers\n",
    "   1. How does alcohol consumption affect mental health among different age groups?\n",
    "   2. How does cannabis use impact stress levels?\n",
    "   3. What is the relationship between smoking and physical health outcomes?\n",
    "   4. Which demographic groups (age, sex, region) are most affected by health barriers?\n",
    "   \n",
    "b. Health Drivers Vs. Health Improvements\n",
    "   1. What is the relationship between regular exercise and self-reported health status?\n",
    "   2. How does stress influence the maintenance or improvement of mental health?"

In the initial dataset, the demographic groups includes people of different gender, age, region and education level. This analysis will explore the impact of each health barries to each demographic group one by one. It's crucial for our analysis to further consider people from differnt demographic groups as the health barries ussually affects peole differntly to their background. To begin data analysis, there are several steps to conduct the data cleaning. The data cleaning process removes the values that are undesired to answering this quiding questions such as \"don't know\", \"refusal\", \"not stated\" and \"valid skip\". Then it will conver the values of all the desired varibels into integer type as the survey response received are all in format of integer. "

    "Based on the above graphs, people at the age of 12 to 17 years drink least often. This is becuase the law forbids minors to drink alcohol. From the age of 18 years to 34 years, people start to drink more often, and then reach the maximum alcohol comsumption frequcny at the age of 50 years to 64 years. However, people at younger age (18 years to 34 years) tend to drink most of alcohol at once. After the age of 35 years, people start to drink less and less alcohol at one occasion. This might be the result of physically aging that the body is less able to handle alcohols over time. "

    "From our analysis we saw that individuals who moderately consume alcohol may report a better self-perceived mental health and life satisfaction.  However, if alcohol consumption becomes excessive, especially in the case of frequent binge drinking, we can see a noticeable decrease in self-perceived mental health and life satisfacation. This trend is noticeable across all age groups to varying degrees.\n",
